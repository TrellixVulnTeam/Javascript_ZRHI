User permissions notes using binary

ignore first 5 bits and focus on last 3 (Read, Write, Execute)
Basic user? (read-only) = 00000100 (4)
Premium user? (write-only) = 0000010 (2)
Admin? (execute-only) = 00000001 (1)


// set permission using |
const readPerm = 4
const write perm = 2
const execute perm = 1

let myPermission = 0
myPermission = myPermission | readPerm | writePerm


// verify user can read
let perms = (myPermission & readPermission)
